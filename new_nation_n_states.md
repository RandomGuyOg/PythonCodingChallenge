This code defines functions and a main function, `new_nation_n_states`, aimed at identifying the most populous "new nation" carved out from a specified number of US states. Let's dissect the code:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - The code imports the Pandas library as `pd` and the NumPy library as `np`. These libraries are commonly used for data manipulation and numerical computations in Python.

2. **Definition of Helper Functions**:
   - `get_top_n_pct_states(sets_of_states, state_population)`: This function calculates the top 50% of state sets based on their population. It accepts two arguments: `sets_of_states`, a list of sets of states, and `state_population`, a dictionary mapping state codes to their populations. It calculates the population sum for each state set, sorts the indices based on population sums in descending order, selects the top 50% of state sets, and returns them as a set.
   - `get_max_pop_set(sets_of_states, state_population)`: This function returns the state set with the maximum population and its corresponding population. It accepts the same arguments as `get_top_n_pct_states`.

3. **Main Function: `new_nation_n_states`**:
   - This function accepts three arguments: `number_len` (the number of states in the new nation), `usstates` (the file path to a CSV file containing US states data), and `border_data` (the file path to a CSV file containing border data between states).
   - It reads the US states data and border data from the provided CSV files using Pandas.
   - It constructs a dictionary `borders_defined_dict` that maps each state to its neighboring states.
   - It iteratively constructs state sets by combining neighboring states until the desired number of states is reached (`number_len`).
   - It utilizes the `get_top_n_pct_states` function to filter out the top 50% of state sets based on population.
   - Finally, it returns the state set with the maximum population and its corresponding population using the `get_max_pop_set` function.


Overall, this code aims to find the most populous "new nation" carved out from a specified number of US states by leveraging state population and border data. It employs a systematic approach to construct and evaluate potential state combinations, ultimately identifying the optimal solution based on population criteria.
