This code aims to identify new nations consisting of a minimum number of states with at least a specified population. Let's break down the code:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - The code imports the Pandas library as `pd` and the NumPy library as `np`. These libraries are commonly used for data manipulation and numerical computations in Python.

2. **Definition of Helper Functions**:
   - `get_top_n_pct_states(sets_of_states, state_population)`: This function calculates the top one-third of state sets based on their population. It accepts two arguments: `sets_of_states`, a list of sets of states, and `state_population`, a dictionary mapping state codes to their populations. It calculates the population sum for each state set, sorts the indices based on population sums in descending order, selects the top one-third of state sets, and returns them as a set.
   - `get_pop_sets(sets_of_states, min_pop, state_population)`: This function filters state sets based on a minimum population threshold (`min_pop` given in millions). It accepts three arguments: `sets_of_states` (list of sets of states), `min_pop` (minimum population threshold), and `state_population` (dictionary mapping state codes to populations). It returns a list of state sets with populations exceeding the specified threshold.

3. **Main Function: `new_nation_with_pop`**:
   - This function accepts three arguments: `min_pop` (minimum population threshold in millions), `usstates` (file path to a CSV file containing US states data), and `border_data` (file path to a CSV file containing border data between states).
   - It reads the US states data and border data from the provided CSV files using Pandas.
   - It constructs a dictionary `borders_defined_dict` that maps each state to its neighboring states.
   - It iteratively constructs state sets by combining neighboring states until it finds sets with populations exceeding the specified threshold (`min_pop`).
   - The iteration continues until it finds at least one set with the required population or until it has considered all possible combinations of states.

4. **Execution**:
   - The code includes a commented-out call to the `new_nation_with_pop` function with sample arguments and a print statement to display the result.
   
Overall, this code provides a systematic approach to identify new nations based on population criteria, leveraging state population data and information about state borders. It explores combinations of states to find sets with populations meeting or exceeding the specified threshold.
