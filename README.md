## Project Description: Rolling Pandas Programming Challenge

### Introduction:
This Programming Challenge is a part of the coursework at Carlson School of Management. This project involves developing efficient algorithms to solve two key problems:

1. **Finding the Most Optimal New Nation from US States**: The first task involves creating a function called `new_nation_n_states`. This function accepts an integer argument `n`, representing the number of US states. It returns the most populous "new nation" formed by combining contiguous states. The goal is to identify a group of states that share borders and collectively have the highest population.

2. **Identifying New Nations Based on Population**: The second task is to implement a function called `new_nation_with_pop`. This function accepts a population threshold (in millions) as an argument. It returns a list of all possible new nations, each consisting of a minimum number of states, with at least the specified population. Once again, the states in each new nation must be contiguous.

### Project Objective:
The primary objective of the Programming Challenge is to develop efficient algorithms to address the two mentioned problems. The solutions should be optimized to provide accurate results within reasonable computation time.

### Approach and Solution:
Our team's solution to the challenge stood in first place within the cohort. We utilized advanced data processing techniques, primarily leveraging the capabilities of the Pandas library in Python. The approach involved meticulous analysis of state-level population data and the spatial relationships between states.

For the `new_nation_n_states` function, we implemented a sophisticated algorithm to iteratively combine contiguous states and determine the new nation with the highest population.

Similarly, for the `new_nation_with_pop` function, we devised an optimized approach to identify all possible new nations meeting the population threshold requirement. This involved strategic grouping and analysis of state populations.

### Project Outcome:
The successful completion of the Programming Challenge demonstrates our team's ability to tackle complex data analysis and algorithmic problems effectively. By securing the first-place position within the cohort, we have showcased our proficiency in data manipulation, problem-solving, and algorithm design.

### Future Enhancements:
While our solution has proven successful, there is always room for improvement. Future enhancements may involve exploring alternative algorithms, optimizing code efficiency further, and incorporating additional data sources for more comprehensive analysis.

### Conclusion:
The Programming Challenge has been a valuable learning experience, allowing us to sharpen our skills in data analysis, algorithm development, and problem-solving. Through collaborative efforts and innovative approaches, we have achieved outstanding results and demonstrated our capabilities in handling real-world data challenges.
